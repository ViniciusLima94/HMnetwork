# HM Network
Code to generate the topology and simulate the network used on our paper "Optimal interplay between synaptic strengths andnetwork structure enhances activity fluctuations andinformation propagation in hierarchical modularnetworks".

## Be aware when lauching the codes all of them use a lot of memory.

# Network Topology

> The code to generate the adjacency matrix is called "gen_madj.py", to run it you have to launch the script "run_madj.sh" (sbatch run_madj.sh), the adjancey matrices will be saved in the directory "conn" with name: madj_m_X_seed_Y.npy, where X is the hierachy of the network and Y the seed used.

# Run the network
